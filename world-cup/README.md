## descrption
we can simulate the entire tournament by repeatedly simulating rounds until we’re left with just one team. And if we want to estimate how likely it is that any given team wins the tournament, we might simulate the tournament many times (e.g. 1000 simulations) and count how many times each team wins a simulated tournament. 1000 simulations might seem like many, but with today’s computing power we can accomplish those simulations in a matter of milliseconds. At the end of this lab, we’ll experiment with how worthwhile it might be to increase the number of simulations we run, given the trade-off of runtime.
